## Instructions
To use the database class in a node based project, clone database.js into your directory. Make sure you have dotenv and mysql installed for your project (run ```npm install mysql dotenv``` if you don't). Create a .env file with

## Support
If you come across any bugs or have any suggestions to improve the code, please feel free to comment! I would love to improve the code and increase the usability, readibility, and utility of this to (hopefully) become an npm package. 

## Project Status
This project came as a result of a coding bootcamp I am currently attending. I wanted to streamline using databases with their common operations (CRUD) and make it easier for my projects. I would love to expand this and continue to build out the functionality.
